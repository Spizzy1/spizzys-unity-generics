Put the "DialougeUI" in the "Dialouge Box" field on the DialougeManager.
Put the "Dialouge text" in the "Text" field.
and put the "dialougeImage" in the "Image" field.

you need to add lists manually as done in the example within the code, you can then call the "displayTree" function with the required paramteters in-order to display dialouge from any script in your game
